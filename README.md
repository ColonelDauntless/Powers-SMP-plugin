The plugin and plugin updates for the Powers SMP
PvP Powers Plugin Description
The PvP Powers Plugin is a dynamic and engaging plugin designed for Minecraft servers to enhance PvP gameplay by introducing unique powers, player-level progression, and strategic mechanics. Each player is assigned a special power, which comes with distinct abilities and limitations, adding depth and excitement to PvP interactions.

Features
1. Unique Player Powers
Players can choose or be assigned special powers such as Ember, Void, Echo, or Frostbite.
Each power comes with unique effects, abilities, and mechanics:
Ember: Players have infinite fire resistance and ignite enemies during PvP combat. Smelts mined ores automatically.
Void: Players accumulate teleportation charges over time, allowing quick escape or positioning during fights.
Echo: Adds explosive force to attacks, dealing extra damage in combat.
Frostbite: Grants enhanced abilities in water, such as water breathing and speed, and imbues boots with Frost Walker enchantments.
2. Power Levels and Progression
Players can progress through 5 power levels. Higher levels grant enhanced benefits, while losing power levels reduces their effectiveness.
Killing another player grants the killer 1 power level while reducing the victim's level by 1.
A "Power Level" item drops for the killer if they are already at the maximum level (5), allowing for strategic use.
3. Death Mechanics
Players only lose power levels when killed by another player. Natural causes (e.g., fall damage, drowning, mobs) do not affect their power levels.
A grace system allows players at Level 0 one extra life before being banned after their next death.
4. Cooldowns and Anti-Abuse
Spam-Kill Prevention: A 3-second cooldown prevents players from repeatedly farming the same target for power levels.
Power Infuser Cooldown: A configurable 1.5-day cooldown prevents players from overusing the Power Infuser to extract or regain power levels.
5. Recipes and Items
Custom crafting recipes for Power Infuser, Power Fragments, and Revival Shards enhance gameplay and provide strategic crafting options.
6. Persistency and Stability
Player powers and levels are saved persistently, ensuring no progress is lost after server restarts or player disconnections.
Automatic cleanup of cooldown maps optimizes performance and prevents memory issues.
7. User-Friendly Feedback
Informative messages notify players about power level changes, cooldowns, and abilities in real-time.
Custom cooldown messages indicate the exact time left for Power Infuser usage or PvP cooldowns.
Bug Fixes and Improvements
The plugin has undergone several iterations, addressing bugs and improving functionality:

Fixed double kill registration, Frostbite water spam, and Echo power invincibility.
Prevented power loss on natural deaths and fixed inventory extraction bugs.
Use Case Scenarios
PvP Servers: Adds a layer of strategy and progression to PvP combat, making fights more dynamic and rewarding.
RPG-Themed Servers: Powers and level progression fit perfectly into RPG gameplay, where players develop unique abilities.
Competitive Arenas: Encourage balanced and fair gameplay with power level caps and cooldowns.
Configuration
The plugin is easily configurable, allowing server admins to:

Adjust cooldown durations.
Customize power abilities and effects.
Enable or disable specific features to fit server needs.
Summary
The PvP Powers Plugin transforms PvP combat into a thrilling experience with strategic depth, unique powers, and competitive progression mechanics. It's designed to be both fun and fair, ensuring long-term engagement for players. Whether you're running a competitive PvP server or an RPG-themed world, this plugin offers a perfect blend of challenge and customization.
